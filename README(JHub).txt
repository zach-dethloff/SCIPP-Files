--Jupyter Hub/Notebooks Set-Up--

Step 0: Step 0(Optional): Install python through anaconda. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. Having anaconda on your system allows you to use the anaconda powershell
instead of the windows powershell, as well as a host of other directories like numpy, matplotlib, and many more we use consistently in this project. It is not necessary as 
we will be using jupyterhub, a virtual environment with these directories also installed, but for editing scripts and debugging code outside its nice to have python source files on your system.

Step 1: Getting into Jupyterhub. Email: Mhance@ucsc.edu and ask for a link to the JupyterHub account if you don't have one already. You will have to create an account, and afterwords should have easy access to JupyterHub. It may be a good idea to save your specific user link somewhere you can easily access as it will be you only way into JupyterHub each time you want to use it.

Step 2: Familiarize yourself. Go into the examples folder and run through the FlatAna.ipynb file. It is also highly advised to run through the uproot-tutorial link as uproot is a crucial part of reading ROOT data using a pure python approach. Run the script and make sure there aren't any issues.

Step 3: Github. At this point its good to familiarize yourself with GitHub. Hopefully you have been asked to create an account by now so that you can be added to the 
GitHub repository. If not make one, and email gstark@cern.ch with your username and that you need to be added to the repository.

Now you should be all caught up in using jupyterhub and if there's any further questions you can email me at:
